# AWS EKS and App Mesh

In this project, we will create a single Node EKS cluster. After that, we will install AWS App Mesh. We will deploy a sample polyglot application and implement traffic routing and mutual TLS authentication. Lastly, we will use the X-Ray service to trace the communication between individual services.
